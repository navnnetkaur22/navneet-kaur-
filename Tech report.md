## Microsoft trims more CPUs from Windows 11 compatibility list

Microsoft has published the list of CPUs supported by Windows 11 24H2 â€“ which confirms to OEMs that if they were hoping to raid stocks of pre-11th-generation Intel CPUs, they're out of luck. 

Intel's 11th-generation chips arrived in 2020 and were discontinued last year. It would be surprising, if not unheard of, for OEMs to build machines with unsupported chips. Intel has already transitioned many pre-11th generation chips to "a legacy software support model," so Microsoft's decision to omit the chips from the OEM list is understandable.

However, this could be seen as a  creeping problem. Chips made earlier than that were present very recently, in the list of supported Intel processors for Windows 11 22H2 and 23H2.
